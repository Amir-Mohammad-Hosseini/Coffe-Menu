#Coffe Menu
<p>I saw this coffee-menu from the [https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and tried to customize it with small changes and publish it on my Github . This website is coded only with html and css and contains 75 lines of html and 81 lines of css . Flexbox is also used in this project .</p>
